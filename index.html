                            <p>Since its foundation as the cave monastery in 1051, the Lavra has been a preeminent
                                center of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Eastern Europe. Together with the Saint
                                Sophia Cathedral, it is inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The
                                monastery complex is considered a separate national historic-cultural preserve
                                (sanctuary), the national status to which was granted on 13 March 1996. The Lavra is
                                not only located in another part of the city, but is part of a different national
                                sanctuary than Saint Sophia Cathedral. While being a cultural attraction, the monastery
                                is once again active, with over 100 monks in residence.[citation needed] It was named
                                one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine on 21 August 2007.
                                Currently, the jurisdiction over the site is divided between the state museum, National
                                Kyiv-Pechersk Historic-Cultural Preserve, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow
                                Patriarchate) as the site of the chief monastery of that Church and the residence of its
                                leader</p>
                            <p>According to the Primary Chronicle, in the early 11th century, Anthony, a Christian monk
                                from Esphigmenon monastery on Mount Athos, originally from Liubech of the Principality
                                of Chernigov, returned to Rus' and settled in Kyiv as a missionary of monastic tradition
                                to Kyivan Rus'. He chose a cave at the Berestov Mount that overlooked the Dnieper River
                                and a community of disciples soon grew. Prince Iziaslav I of Kyiv ceded the whole mount
                                to the Anthonite monks who founded a monastery built by architects from Constantinople.
                            </p>
                            <p>The word pechera means cave. The word lavra is used to describe high-ranking male
                                monasteries for monks of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Therefore, the name of the
                                monastery is also translated as Kyiv Cave Monastery, Kyiv Caves Monastery or the Kiev
                                Monastery of the Caves</p>

                        <div class="screen_text">
                            <p>Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv (Ukrainian: Кий, Щек, Хорив) were three legendary brothers—often
                                mentioned along with
                                their sister Lybid (Ukrainian: Либідь)—who, according
                                to the Primary Chronicle, founded the medieval city of Kyiv, which eventually became
                                the capital of Kyivan Rus' and present-day Ukraine. There is no precise and historically
                                established information about the rule of Kyi and the establishment of the city of
                                Kyiv.</p>
                            <p>In the Primary Chronicle which is traditionally believed to have been written by a monk
                                of Kyiv Cave Monastery by the name of Nestor and finished in 1113, a special place is
                                held by the legend about the foundation of Kyiv by three brothers. In the legend,
                                Nestor places those brothers onto various hills of Kyiv. Geographically, the old Kyiv
                                is located on a higher right bank of Dnieper which is an extension of the Dnieper Upland
                                where remnants of the Church of the Tithes are located.
                                The Chronicle further states that there were people ("who did not know what were
                                saying") who considered Kyi a mere ferryman. But, then it argues that Kyi as a prince
                                of his gens was visiting Czargrad and received great honors from the Emperor. Dmitry
                                Likhachov combined attestations of the Nikon Chronicle which also indicates that Kyi
                                with a great army marched onto Czargrad and received great honors from the Emperor.
                                During his expedition to Constantinople, Kyi also found a city of Kyivets on the
                                Danube.
                                Nestor also names the approximate date of the assault on Kyiv by the Khazar Empire as
                                "after the death of Kyi" which confirms the hypothesis of Boris Rybakov, 6th-7th
                                centuries. In his chronicle Nestor does not indicate the date of Kyi's death nor the
                                existence or absence of his heirs who continued to rule after his death. The
                                chronicle does mention a meeting between local residents with the arrived Askold and Dir
                                who asked them referring to Kyiv, whose city it was and received the answer that the
                                three brothers who built it were long dead and the residents now paid tribute to the
                                Khazars. However, the Polish historian Jan Długosz drew attention to the Przemysł
                                Chronicle that asserts "after the death of Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv their children and
                                grandchildren who descended from them by direct lineage ruled for many years".</p>

                        <div class="screen_text">
                            <p>The Mariinskyi Palace (Ukrainian: Маріїнський палац, Mariinskyi palats) is the official
                                ceremonial residence of the President of Ukraine. The Elizabethan baroque palace is
                                sited on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kyiv, Ukraine, adjoining the
                                neo-classical building of the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament of Ukraine.</p>
                            <p>The palace was constructed by command of the Russian Empress Elizaveta Petrovna in 1744;
                                her architect was Bartolomeo Rastrelli, the most eminent architect working in the
                                Russian Empire at that time. One of the students of Rastrelli, Ivan Michurin, together
                                with a group of other architects, completed the palace in 1752. Empress Elizabeth,
                                however, did not live to see the palace completed; the first senior-ranking member of
                                the Imperial Family to stay in the palace was Empress Elizabeth's niece-in-law, Empress
                                Catherine II, who visited Kyiv in 1787. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the
                                palace was the main residence of the Governors-General.
                                In the early 19th century, the palace burned down in a series of fires, and was in total
                                disrepair and abandoned for almost half a century. In 1870, Emperor Alexander II had the
                                palace reconstructed by the architect Konstantin Mayevsky, using old drawings and
                                watercolours as a guide. It was then renamed after the reigning Empress Maria
                                Alexandrovna. By her wish, a large park was established off the southern side of the
                                palace. The palace was used as a residence for visiting members of the Imperial Family
                                until 1917.
                                During the years of the Russian Civil War in 1917-20, the palace was used as the Kyiv
                                revkom headquarters, particularly during the Kyiv Bolshevik Uprising. In the 1920s, the
                                building belonged to an agricultural school, soon after which it became a museum. The
                                Mariinskyi was badly damaged during the Second World War, and was restored at the end of
                                the 1940s. Another major restoration was completed in the early 1980s.</p>
                            <p>Whilst the Presidential Standard was not typically flown above the residence of the
                                Ukrainian president, it has become increasingly common, in recent years, for the
                                standard to be raised above the Maryinsky Palace - particularly when the President is in
                                residence or hosting other heads of state. This change in protocol has brought Ukraine
                                more into line with other European nations, in which it is common practice to fly the
                                head of state's standard as a symbol of the authority of their office.</p>
